# GRUD
This is a simple GRUD made in node.js

The database was created in xampp and was exported.

the node modules werent included but i think it will be created by default, just download and install the following dependencies:
express, mysql, body-parser, and hbs

or just type the following in the command promp:
npm install --save express mysql body-parser hbs

thank you! :)
